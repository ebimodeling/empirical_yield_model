# Material and methods

## Data

## Statistical Models 

We have three classes: linear regression, regression tree, and 'black box' or artificial neural network.

### Linear Regression

Used for comparison

### Regression Tree

#### CART

CART is a recursive partitioning method to be used both for regression and classification. CART is constructed by splitting subsets of the data set using all predictor variables to create two child nodes repeatedly, beginning with the entire data set. The best predictor is chosen using a variety of impurity or diversity measures. The goal is to produce subsets of the data which are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable (Breiman et al., 1984). In this study, we used {}

#### M5-prime

M5â€™ algorithm (M5-prime) by Wang and Witten, which is an enhancement of the original M5 model tree algorithm
(Wang, Y., & Witten, I. H. (1996). Induction of model trees for predicting continuous classes.)

#### Adaboost

The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction.

### Artificial neural network

#### MLP (multi-layer perceptrons)

# Results

## Data: 

First start with some basic exploratory analyses - map, histogram, relationships among variables.

climate range, geographic range, univariate relationships ('pairs' plot)

## Linear Regression

## Regression Tree

## Artificial neural network
