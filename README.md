
# Application of machine learning algorithm in understanding growth pattern of miscanthus

/paper/
contains two papers, describing growth pattern of miscanthus in the paper folder. 
one paper on meta decision tree.

./mxgdata/
contains a simple csv file wit observed miscanthus data

./Rscripts/
contains a simple R script to visualize miscanthus data

./figures/
contains plots/visualization of miscanthus data.


## Research Questions:
1. Can we come up with an machine learning  alternative for meta analyses performed in the two papers with improved prediction capabity and classifier definition.
2. Can machine learning help us to identify when miscanthus will respond to Nitrogen and when it does not? given the input data set, independent variables could be species, growth stange, site (N deposition rate), irrigation, etc.
